The extract_promoter_data() function errors if you give it a feature from the BPROM file
which has a number of predicted promoters of 0. This makes sense, however it needs to be fixed.
2 possibilities:
    (1) Filter out the features which have "Number of predicted promoters -      0" from the
        initial bprom file after reading it in
        - This is fine as long as we don't need this data for anything
        - This is also the best solution as it prevents this error from happening for other
          data extractions

FIXED
For some reason, removing the ones with predicted promoters = 0 is not consistently
removing the features. It removes most, but not all?? Very confusing.
Del alters the indexes after you delete an element, therefore when looping through and
deleting elements in a list, you must delete in REVERSE ORDER or you will delete
at i+1 after the first deletion, i+2 after the second, etc instead of deleting at i
as intended.

To Do

- Test other BPROM output files
- Convert data to GFF3

- Need to calculate the promoter START and END positions in the genome using the
retrieved test location START and END (obtained with extract_test_seq_position())
    - What constitutes the start and end of a promoter? Is the -35 position the START?
    Is the -35 position + 35 the END of the promoter?
    - Why doesn't the -35 position + 35 equal "Promoter Pos:     X" in the BPROM output??
    - When calculating the - strand start and end positions, is the -35 box position counting
    up from the start CDS or the end CDS??
