The extract_promoter_data() function errors if you give it a feature from the BPROM file
which has a number of predicted promoters of 0. This makes sense, however it needs to be fixed.
2 possibilities:
    (1) Filter out the features which have "Number of predicted promoters -      0" from the
        initial bprom file after reading it in
        - This is fine as long as we don't need this data for anything
        - This is also the best solution as it prevents this error from happening for other
          data extractions
